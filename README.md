## Create Bootable USB Disk
Download the latest version of macOS Big Sur from the App Store. You will need a USB flash drive with at least 16GB. You will need to format the disk using `Disk Utility` with **Format** `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)` and **Scheme** `GUID Partition Map`. After the disk is formatted run the command below to prepare the disk. Please replace `YOUR_FLASH_DRIVE_NAME_HERE` with your newly formatted flash drive name.

````
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/YOUR_FLASH_DRIVE_NAME_HERE
````

## Copy EFI
You will need to mount the `EFI` partition to make copy `EFI` files from this repository. To Mount `EFI` partition you may use [Mount EFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI) tool.

After mounting the `EFI` drive, Please copy all files from `EFI` to your newly mounted `EFI` drive. Now you can configure the `EFI/OC/config.plist` file with your own/fake `PlatformInfo`. To generate `PlatformInfo` you can use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS).

Do all BIOS setup things listed above and boot the flash drive.


Now, I can say "Best Of Luck!" only.


Happy Hacking!


### Fix Display Pink/Magenta Tint
Well, this is the most common issue since High Sierra. Maybe apple dropped the older display? Anyway, there is a way to fix this by generating a custom patched display override.

To generate the custom override for the unsupported display you can use [this tool](https://github.com/mbruggmann/osx-edid-overrides).

Note: My two displays is generated by [this tool](https://gist.github.com/adaugherity/7435890).
